# ML Based Enhanced Road Safety

Our project, undertaken as part of CMPT 733 - Big Data Lab II, aims to revolutionize road safety and efficiency by harnessing the power of machine learning and data analysis. We are a dedicated team of students from Simon Fraser University, comprising Midhun Jisha Manoj, Risheek Sood, and Shaik Sohail Hasan, working towards a safer and more efficient urban transportation system.
